# Examples

This directory contains a few examples of using the TypeGraphQL Prisma 2 integration:

- **Basic** - the workflow of using the generator that creates TypeGraphQL artifacts from Prisma 2 schema and creating a GraphQL schema with CRUD resolvers and custom methods

  <https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/prisma/examples/1-basic>

- **Picking Actions** - demonstrating how you can choose certain Prisma actions to be exposed in the GraphQL schema

  <https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql/tree/prisma/examples/2-picking-actions>

To run some example, simply go to the subdirectory, install the dependencies (`npm i`) and then start the server (`npm start`).

Each subdirectory contains a `examples.gql` file with a predefined GraphQL queries that you can use in GraphQL Playground (<http://localhost:4000>) and play with them by modifying it's shape and data.
